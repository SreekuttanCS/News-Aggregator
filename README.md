Realtime News Aggregator â€“ Full-Stack Web Application

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This is a full-stack web application that fetches real-time news from external sources using News APIs (e.g., NewsAPI, NY Times API). Users can filter news by category, search articles, and save their favorite articles for later reading. The backend is developed with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, while the frontend (to be developed) will use React.js.

This project follows modern web development practices, including RESTful API design, MongoDB CRUD operations, and secure authentication (JWT-based).
